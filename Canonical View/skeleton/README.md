## Requirements

* node.js

## Installation

Run `npm install` in the root of the project directory.


## Run

The command:

`npm run start`

will start a webserver on port 8080 combined with a watcher that recompiles every changed (typescript) file within this folder.


## Developing

The main entrypoint is `src/main.ts`. Start there with programming.

The files in `src/lib/` are from us provided global utilities.

Sometimes we also provide some helper files (e.g. `src/helper.ts`) that provides you with exercise specific functions.
